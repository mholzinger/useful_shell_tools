RUNNING FROM THE COMMAND LINE

This script can be run like any UNIX tool from the command line or
called from another script.

Before starting:

- Use this script at your own risk.  Read it first and understand it.

- Log in as an administrator (you must have sudo privileges)

- Copy this script to any location you like (such as /usr/bin/local/)

- Ensure this file has Unix line endings, or it won't run.


Running:

- Run the script using "sudo" (enter your password if prompted)

      sudo ./kickstart -restart -agent


Command-line switches:

The optional "parent" switches activate the top level kickstart features:

-uninstall
-install
-deactivate 
-activate 
-configure 
-stop
-restart

These features can be selected independently, but will always be done
in the order shown above.

For anything interesting to happen, you *must* specify one or more of
the parent options, plus one or more child options for those that
require them.  Child options will be ignored unless their parent
option is also supplied.

All options are switches (they take no arguments), except for -package
<path> -users <userlist> and -mask <number>, as noted below.

  -files    ## Uninstall all ARD-related files
  -settings ## Remove access privileges in System Preferences

                        ## ... or grant any these privileges...

ARD has four main components:

1) ARD Helper
2) ARD Agent & associated daemons
3) ARD Menu Extra    (controlled by the SystemUIServer)
4) ARD Admin Console (if you have an Administrator license)


What this script does:

1) Any running ARD components will be stopped as needed.  For example,
   they'll be stopped before an uninstall, reinstall, or restart
   request.  They will not be restarted unless you specify the
   -restart options.

2) Components will be restarted as required.  For example, restarting
   the administrator console forces a restart of the agent.
   Restarting the agent, in turn, forces a restart of the helper.

3) If you -uninstall but don't specify a new installer to run, then
   the -restart family of switches will be ignored.

4) Options can be specified in any order, but remember that the
   options are ignored unless their parent options are specified.  For
   example, -package is ignored unless -install is specified.


RUNNING THIS SCRIPT FROM A GUI

You can make yourself a GUI-based kickstarter program to run this
script if you like.  The options, set in the console, can be conveyed
via environment variables to this script, per a spec shown in the
source code for this script (or the traditional way using command-line
switches).  Be sure the console application runs this script with sudo
privileges. The console should also specify its own location in the
APP environment variable, and may specify the location of a
STRINGS_FILE to use to load string definitions for any localizable
messages produced by this script.

A GUI console could stay up & running between runs of the script but
should avoid running multiple instances of this script at the same
time.



WARNING

This script can be used to grant very permissive incoming access
permissions.  Do not use the -activate and -configure features unless
you know exactly what you're doing.
